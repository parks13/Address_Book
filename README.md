## About
This is a simple address book program designed using Qt. It mimics the use of old phones where you press dialers multiple times to write the desired words.


## How to use
Use Qt to run AddressBook.pro, compile, build, and run it.
Within the running application, import the AddressBook Sample.csv to see how it functions. The result will show based on the number you type in and the alphabets that corresponds.
